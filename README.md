This repository is the implementation code and video of our two paper as follows:

# 1) ICK-Track
ICK-Track: A Category-level 6-DoF Pose Tracker Using Inter-frame Consistent Keypoints for Aerial Manipulation
by Sun et al. at National Engineering Laboratory for Robot Visual Perception and Control (RVC-NATIONAL ENGNEERING LAB) and Robotics ADVANCe Lab, ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory. The framework is used for category-level 6D object pose tracking.

# 2) Robust6oF
Robust6oF: Towards Real-World Aerial Vision Guidance with Categorical 6D Pose Tracker. We introduce a pose-driven servo paradigm to achieve the aerial vision guidance task for aerial manipulation, which contains a category-level 6-DoF pose tracker and a Pose-Aware Discrete Servo Policy called PAD-Servo to perform real-world vision guidance task.
