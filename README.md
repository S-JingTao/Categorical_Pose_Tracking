This repository is the implementation code and video of our two paper as follows:

# 1) ICK-Track (IROS 2022 oral paper)
## ICK-Track: A Category-level 6-DoF Pose Tracker Using Inter-frame Consistent Keypoints for Aerial Manipulation 

The work is a collaborative effort between the National Engineering Research Centre for Robot Visual Perception and Control (RVC-NERC) and the Robotics ADVANCe Lab, ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory.

# 2) Robust6oF (TPAMI 2025)
## Robust6oF: Towards Real-World Aerial Vision Guidance with Categorical 6D Pose Tracker.
We introduce a pose-driven servo paradigm to achieve the aerial vision guidance task for aerial manipulation, which contains a category-level 6-DoF pose tracker and a Pose-Aware Discrete Servo Policy called PAD-Servo to perform real-world vision guidance task.
